Just take a picture of ur ISBN barcode with the built-in camera and records the name of the book in the database.

A very simple program made using Tkinter GUI and integrated with sqlite3 as it's DBMS.
Along with a barcode scanner from pyzbar and a WEB-Scrapper to find the name of the book using the barcode to save the book into the database.
